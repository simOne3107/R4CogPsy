# Welcome to **R** 4 CogPsy

Here you will find everything I have been learning about R and statistics. I hope my notes will be useful to other research students struggling with R and statistics.

## R as a calculator

One of the simplest and easiest things you can do in R is to use it as a calculator.

- Addition
```r
1 + 1
```
```r
[1] 2
```

- Subtraction
```r
3 - 1
```
```r
[1] 2
```

- Multiplication
```r
4 * 5
```
```
[1] 20
```

- Division
```r
40 / 5
```
```r
[1] 8
```
- Square root
```r
sqrt (9)
```
```
[1] 3
```

## Creating variables

In R, you can easily create `variables` and assign different values to them. You can see in the examples below that pretty much anything can be used as a variable's name.

```r
NewVariable <- 2 + 2
Price <- 9.99
ReactionTime <- 567
wordcount <- 16785
```

The new `variable` will be stored in R. Type the variable's name in the R console to see the value which is associated with it.

```r
NewVariable
```
```r
[1] 4
```
