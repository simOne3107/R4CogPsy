## R as a calculator

One of the simplest and easiest things you can do in R is to use it as a calculator.

- Addition
```r
1 + 1
```

- Subtraction
```r
3 - 1
```

- Multiplication
```r
4 * 5
```

- Division
```r
40 / 5
```

## Creating variables

In R, you can easily create `variables` and assigning different values to them.

```r
NewVariable <- 2 + 2
```

```r
NewVariable
```
